# TODO List

Primary Goal: Implement Scene Transition Manager to better manage scene transitions

* Scene Transition Manager for moving between scenes. Currently everytime, we
   save the character manually on the button click.


1. Shop needs to be Serializable (Not sure if this is true anymore)
2. Consider CharacterEquipmentManifest becoming EquipmentManifest and removing the character argument in the constructor
   * CharacterEquipmentManifest should not take a character, should just have
     the character attached. Too easy to "equip" using another characters stats.
3. IEquippable needs a better deserialization method. Potentially could write a
   "InterfaceSerializationWrapper" which stores information about deserializing
   the associated interface.
4. Consider generalizing the CharacterInspectorEditor to work for anything that
   implements an "AsJson" / "IObservable"
   * a UnityEditor drawer for ICharacter / IEquipment / IInventory
6. Add in Hitpoints / other stats to character
7. Create "combat" system
8.  Add "forest" to the town hub
9.  Add an armor Shop
10. Add "healer" to town?
11. Add Potions? / Useable items?
12. Need IEquipmentManifest to return IResults rather than bool
13. Add drag and drop buy and sell to shop
14. Add Item information to Status / Inventory. When clicking on item, should
    get information about that item. Similar to shop.

# Potential Abstractions (Code Smells)

## ObservableComponent
Consider rewriting `ObservableComponent` to only allow observing
`IObservable<T>` rather than just `<T>`. See `ObservableCharacter` for possible
implementation details.

Consider renaming `ObservableComponent` to not have the word `Observable`
perhaps `Changeable` / `Watchable` / `ObservableContainer`?

## Dialogs share copy / paste code
See `MessageDialog`, `SellDialog`, and `PurchaseDialog`. Should likely have a parent type `Dialog<Renderable<T>>`

# Known Bugs

1. Bug in Character Creator / Ability Score Label. If Modifier is greater than 1
   character, does not display properly.
