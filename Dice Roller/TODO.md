# TODO List

Primary Goal:  Implement a Combat System

* Create "combat" system
* Victory / Defeat conditions?

* Fix typo for IHasPortrait (from IHasPortriat)
* Consider redesign of Combat scene to provide a sense of URGENCY!
* Add Traits to Status Screen
* Add Total Defense to Status Screen?
* Implement Audio system that can withstand scene transitions
* Nice to have: string extension for ".AsAbilityRoll()"
* CombatantInspector/Editor
* Code Smell: CombatantRenderer and TraitManifestRenderer both have lazy loaded
  sub properties using Property. Code is identical / copy and paste. We should
  consider how to abstract this.


1. Consider SpriteDatabase using a Tree structure for "sub" portraits
2. Add Health / Stamina to Status screen
3. Shop needs to be Serializable (Not sure if this is true anymore)
4. Consider CharacterEquipmentManifest becoming EquipmentManifest and removing the character argument in the constructor
   * CharacterEquipmentManifest should not take a character, should just have
5. Consider generalizing the CharacterInspectorEditor to work for anything that
   implements an "AsJson" / "IObservable"
   * a UnityEditor drawer for ICharacter / IEquipment / IInventory
6.  Add an armor Shop
7.  Add "healer" to town?
8.  Add Potions? / Useable items?
9.  Need IEquipmentManifest to return IResults rather than bool
10. Add drag and drop buy and sell to shop
11. Add Item information to Status / Inventory. When clicking on item, should
    get information about that item. Similar to shop.
12. If possible, we would like to "fail fast" on scene load if a Location is not
    available in the Build settings

# Potential Abstractions (Code Smells)

## ObservableComponent
Consider rewriting `ObservableComponent` to only allow observing
`IObservable<T>` rather than just `<T>`. See `ObservableCharacter` for possible
implementation details.

Consider renaming `ObservableComponent` to not have the word `Observable`
perhaps `Changeable` / `Watchable` / `ObservableContainer`?

## Dialogs share copy / paste code
See `MessageDialog`, `SellDialog`, and `PurchaseDialog`. Should likely have a parent type `Dialog<Renderable<T>>`

# Known Bugs

1. Bug in Character Creator / Ability Score Label. If Modifier is greater than 1
   character, does not display properly.
